Reminding me by the hour

Can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why you can't be any other way, any other way.

Since you drained all the color out of the sky
How am I supposed to feel
It's like I'm living in somebody else's life

But one day when you're old and gray
Don't look back and never say
You should have tried 
Stayin' up all night

What's up with those tears in your eyes
What happened when you shut down,
And all the amber lights turned into red
In the silence of your cave, you feel safe
You decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead

Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise up little girl
'Cause only you can Madeleine

Oh Madeleine

Remember when we used to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out
You wrote it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And you'd put it in a movie, maybe be the movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away

Hold on, don't let go
Hold on and you'll know
Help is on its way

Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally

Was lookin' to be your fella
I found my inspiration
Hidin' in your expression
So I put myself forward
For your consideration

And I know
I'm so
In love
With you
I'm finding it harder and harder to breath
Every time I hear
My beautiful woman

And so we put the top down
To take you drivin' downtown
I guess we'll know just what to do
When you're lookin' to fool around

It's too late to stop me
I know we're gonna get down

Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet, almost every night.
And when I'm outta town to go and do work,
I'm first class every flight.
If she takes the time to open her eyes,
She can realize that she's a dream...
'Cause she knows me...

Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
Cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me...
That's why I make her say... Ooh
Make her say... Ah
Make her say... Uh
Make her say... Ah

Shorty don't know who I am...

And I'm cool with that, if she says so
I even got a lot to her
And when I'm out making pesos?
Ain't nobody treat her like I do her.
'Cause I'm the one that she thinks about,
The only one on her mind,
She's a dream...
'Cause she knows me...

Shorty don't know that I'm on the stage,
Like 3 or 4 times a week
She don't even know I've been around the world
And all the different girls and me.
But there's just one, face that I see
She's the only one for me
She's a dream...
'Cause she knows me...
Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
Cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me...
That's why I make her say... Ooh
Make her say... Ah
Make her say... Uh
Make her say... Ah

See, shorty don't know who I am
That's not good for us, 'cause I know,
It's not good to fuss
And I know she loves me, for me
And I love her, for her
But It wouldn't work if she ever gave
A damn 'bout who I am but she knows me

She don't know I'm a celebrity,
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
Cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me...
Uuuuuh
Make her say... Ah
Make her say... Uh
Make her say... Ah

In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you too"

And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I've never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be if we're nothing more than dreamers
Who believe that we see no wall between us
How can they be in my heart and in my mind,

I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more them mysteries and lies

There you were, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
The helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

I'll be the one (I'll be the one)
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light (I'll be the light)
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

To hold you 
And make sure that you'll be alright
'Cause my fear is gone
And I want to take you from darkness to light

There you were, wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me

I can show you what true love means
Just take my hand, begging please
