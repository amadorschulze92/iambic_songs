Is it too much to ask for
One minute to breath
Cause you take my breath away
Like I'd never sink

You're the reason why cave men drew on the walls
The reason why after every summer we fall

You're the reason I never wanna sleep at night
Cause nothing that I could dream
It's better the you by my side

You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I, 
I'm so in love I can die right now and be fine, I need you tonight
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody

When you wake up with no make up
You try hiding your face,
You know that I, and it's so cute,
You don't even know
How beautiful you are in me

You're the reason why cave men drew on the wall
It's the reason why after every summer we fall
And the way that you look in those purple jeans
It's the sexiest thing I ever see

You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I 
I'm so in love I can die right now and be fine I need you tonight
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I

When the games on
You wear the jersey of my favorite team
I yell at the TV...
You're not even mad of me
You know I love you baby

I love somebody, love somebody
I know, I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I, I'm so in love
I can die right now and be fine, I need you tonight
You know that I love somebody, love somebody

And next you're crying on the phone
Love will keep you up all night
You've got a taste of sweet divine

I don't mean to scare you
But everybody has a first time
But one day when you're old and gray
Don't look back and never say
You should have tried 
Stayin' up all night

Moving high, moving low

And tell 'em all to mind their business
Will for the grumps and cynics
Been that way from the beginning

Of the night
Where it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Oh Oh

I looked down
And my shirts turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice in my ear
Like I missed you
Want you tonight

Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Oh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Oh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)

Thought I moved
More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone
Oh oh

Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can't, I just can't
Ignore this feeling
Said she misses me
And she wants me

Trying to make believe that nothin's wrong

Living in the in between

Disappointed, jerked around
In this cold, cold world

Don't hesitate I'll be right where you are
Open your eyes
There's a crack in the dark

You never let me see you cryin'
You locked it somewhere deep inside
Baby, baby, let me hold you tight

Make it all right

Yeah Yeah
I won't turn against you
Baby, baby, it's gonna be all right
'Cause I'm by your side
When the whole world turns against you
Yeah Yeah

You can let go

You've been holding on so long
Trying to make believe that nothin's wrong
Not letting it show
And there ain't nothing you can do
To make me turn away from you
I need you to know"
