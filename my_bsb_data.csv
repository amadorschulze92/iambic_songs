Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay, baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?

Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to

I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun, the stars, the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way, believe me
Even through the darkest night, you know

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love, as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure, I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world to know

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love, as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need

This scene's so hypnotic 
Smoking mirrors, lights and magic 
Paper faces in gold 
There's solider boys, beauty queens 
Everyone's a mystery 
It's got me losing control 

Yearning, I'm yearning for the one to steal my eyes 
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All through the night and day 
My masquerade, I need you baby 
So stay with me tonight

One's a king that suffering 
Moving high, moving low 
Burning, I'm burning, can't you see it in my eyes? 
Wanna play in this game of disguise

1500,Shattered,"I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh
"
12400,Shattered,"<So empty, can't feel no more,
As I'm left with my tears on the floor
I wait for my heart to mend,
But you keep tearing a hole

Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting for too long

And now I'm shattered,
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(Felt) it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ah)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

What am I still here for,
Could it be that I'm just waiting
Hoping you'd rescue me,
And put the pieces together again

Inside, I'm so lost,
In the middle of my heart
It's a battlefield of love,
I've been fighting for too long

And now I'm shattered
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(Felt it slipped from you hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ah)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh

Tell me what you're really here for,
If you never really loved me
I gave my all but it still wasn't enough

'Cause all you had to say was that you ain't
Looking for commitment
Instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, oh-ho

You took my emotions
And scattered them on the ground
So hard to just pick up,
And move on with life, again
And now I'm shattered (Ooh)
(From the chip in my heart, kept taking it till it broke)
Oh how it hurts
(Felt it slipped from your hand, hit the ground and now it's shattered)
I'm so shattered
(Can't believe it was me, I'm so shattered)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you and me, ah)
So shattered
(Can't believe, you left me, I'm so shattered)
I'm shattered, cut from with-inside, oh
So shattered

Can't believe, you and me, ah"

If you want to talk you can call
And no it's not your fault

I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia

More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone
Oh oh

Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can't, I just can't
Ignore this feeling
Said she misses me
And she wants me
Wants me tonight

A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Oh

In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Oh Oh

And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you've done

Hey hey hey

The sun is over the city but it's an orange day
There is reason for looking up but I'm feeling down
You see I've got to catch a plane, won't buy a ticket
'Cause it's hard to stop when you're spinning around

It's a weird world don't you know it?
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it

Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way, just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love
It's a weird world, yeah

Sent a message to a GI in the desert
Said thank you man for bringing another dawn
Back here it's her and me and we're having our first baby
He's out there taking them on

It's a weird world and I know you know it
It's a weird world and it won't slow down
It's a weird world no matter how you roll it
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way, just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love

I'm closing my eyes but I'm starting to see
While he's looking at you, she's looking at me
The only thing he does is just keep me away from you
Sure, part of this place would cheer if I die
But don't let them take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile
Take away your beautiful smile

Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way just stand up and fight it
Hey hey hey sweet baby
There's a way for you to decide it
Hey hey hey
Never give up and don't let it wear out, your love

(Hey hey hey)
It's a weird world don't you know it?
(Hey hey hey)
It's a weird world don't you know it?
(Hey hey hey)
It's a weird world don't you know it?
Hey hey hey"
