I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love

As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way, believe me
Even through the darkest night, you know

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you ask me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to

Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure, I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world to know

I'd go anywhere for you

You said no, but I found out
Darling, that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again

Desperately waiting on a chance
I know you're out there
Holding on
Holding out for me
Are we gonna know the time is right
What if you're here and I'm just blind

There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for
Will you be Unmistakable?

How can I know a song I've never heard?
How will I know your voice when you haven't said a word?
How do I know how this will end
Before we begin?
(Before we begin?)

There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams

Took the stage then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered but I don't care
And the people walkin' by don't have a clue

Till the sun was in our eyes
Till the afternoon arrived
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks

The one you hate to love is made for you

Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
Will my imagination take it slow (oh yeah)
How decidedly my life has changed
In a moment it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is letting go.

And I miss your face

Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I'm running blind
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts

And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out

And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And you'd put it in a movie, maybe be the movie star
